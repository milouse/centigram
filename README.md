# Centigram

> A minimalist CSS framework.

## Why it's awesome

Centigram provides a minimal setup of styles for a fast and clean starting
point. Just it! **Only 2.5kb gzipped!** It's not about a UI
framework. Specially designed for better performance and higher productivity
with fewer properties to reset resulting in cleaner code. Hope you enjoy!

Centigram is a friendly fork of [Milligram](https://milligram.io/), which
seems a bit discontinuated at the time of 2022.

## Differences from Milligram

- Move to upstream release 1.5 (never published)
- Merge [feature/98-css-variable](https://github.com/milligram/milligram/pull/262)
- Merge [feature/99-remove-flex-basis](https://github.com/milligram/milligram/pull/263)
- Merge [215-breakpoint-update](https://github.com/milligram/milligram/pull/265)
- Fix some typo in contributing file [upstream #298](https://github.com/milligram/milligram/pull/298)
- Remove dependency on CSS reset or Google Font. Centigram recommends you the
  [Inter font family](https://rsms.me/inter/), but it is up to you to set your
  own fonts set. Customize the `$font-family` Sass variable or `--font-family`
  CSS variable for that.
- Add a dark theme
- Add notifications widget
- Add a center text class
- Support input type time
- Support disabled and readonly fields
- And more…
