# Centigram

> A minimalist CSS framework.

## Why it's awesome

Centigram provides a minimal setup of styles for a fast and clean starting
point. Just it! **Only 2.5kb gzipped!** It's not about a UI
framework. Specially designed for better performance and higher productivity
with fewer properties to reset resulting in cleaner code. Hope you enjoy!

Centigram is a friendly fork of [Milligram](https://milligram.io/), which
seems a bit discontinuated at the time of 2022.

The following documentation will still refer to Milligram website until I take
time to import it back here.
